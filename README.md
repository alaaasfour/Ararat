# Ararat 
Ararat is my comprehensive E-commerce web application. 
I used many web development technologies such as React, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose.

The website has the following features:
  1. User Authentication: users can create their own account with their own credentials and freely login/logout to their account, and see their order history.
  2. Shopping cart: users can order products from sellers and add as many products as they wish.
  3. Check out/Payment: users can purchase and pay for their products using PayPal or their credit card safely.
  4. User profile: users can change their usernames and passwords freely.
  5. Super User: the super user has the authority to see the information of all users (not their credentials), and the authority to remove or add users.
  6. Search and Sort: users have the ability to search for certain products and filter results according to rating or price.
  7. Rating and reviews: users can add their own rating and review for a certain product where other users can see.
